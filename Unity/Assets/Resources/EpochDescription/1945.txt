You have arrived in 1945: Prior to World War II, Oberwiesenfeld was a bustling military barracks and parade ground, primarily utilized for military training. However, the war brought about a dramatic transformation. In the aftermath of the conflict, masses of rubble from the devastated city of Munich were transported to Oberwiesenfeld, turning it into one of the three major dumping sites of World War II. Interestingly, while the other two hills were later repurposed as local recreational parks in the late 1950s, the rubble dump at Oberwiesenfeld persevered as the sole operational site. This unique historical context makes Oberwiesenfeld a distinctive location, encapsulating the remnants of a turbulent past. As you explore this intriguing era, envision the stories embedded within the layers of wartime debris that shaped the very landscape before you.
