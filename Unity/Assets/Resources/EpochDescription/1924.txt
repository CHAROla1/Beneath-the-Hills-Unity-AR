Welcome to the year 1924: The Olympiapark as you know it today is not even close to being planned. This area is still known as ‘Oberwiesenfeld’ at this time and is mainly used as a plane landing area, later even as a commercial airport called ‘Flughafen München Oberwiesenfeld’. It was named ‘Oberwiesenfeld’ as it was the large agricultural area behind the Wiesenfeld country estate. Even before the First World War there was an airfield in the northern part of the Oberwiesenfeld, initially as a landing field for balloons. The first landing of a steerable rigid airship in 1909 caused a great stir among the people of Munich designed by Ferdinand Graf Zeppelin.
