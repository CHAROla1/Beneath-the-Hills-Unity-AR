As the echoes of war have long faded away, you find yourself in Munich in 1972, where a remarkable metamorphosis awaits you: a once desolate rubble mountain has been reborn as a majestic Olympic mountain. Through careful engineering and the visionary touch of Behnisch & Partner Architects, in collaboration with landscape architect GÃ¼nther Grzimek, the towering heap of debris has been sculpted into a stunning elevation.
Rising to an impressive height of 55 meters, the Olympic mountain proudly stands as the tallest peak in Munich. Its metamorphosis is a testament to the power of landscape gardening and architectural ingenuity. This remarkable endeavor was undertaken in preparation for the Olympic Games of 1972, which unfolded right here in Munich - sadly ending in a tragedy with a terrorist attack on the Israeli Olympic Team. Nevertheless it was decided that the Olympic games must go on. The Olympic mountain stands as a testament to human resilience and the ability to transform adversity into greatness and making the best out of the existing situation.
